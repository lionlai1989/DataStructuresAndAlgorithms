I finished most of exams except<br>
'00_process_packages.py'<br>
'01_merging_tables.py'<br>
'02_hash_substring.py'<br>
'03_rope.py'<br>
<br>
#**Important Note:**#<br>
In 01_job_queue.py, time exceeds limit when using my heap function, so I turned to using python module heapq. But heapq module looks no better than my code. It also uses sift_down and sift_up function.<br> 
In 03_set_range_sum.py, I implement insert, erase and search by myself. Wateching splay tree visualization helps to solve this problem.<br>

Strange thing is that the logic between online visualization and lecture is not really the same, and online visulization seems to more makes sense to me.
